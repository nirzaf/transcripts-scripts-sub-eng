1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,350
It goes so we'll be starting a new section of our API development and really actually this is just about

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,600
value added features.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,290
We've done quite a bit of work.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,800
We already have a functioning API with a nice, clean architecture that can be easily extended.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,810
However, there are certain things that we want to take advantage of when it comes to core.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:30,060
And these features are these allowances will enable us to reduce some of the repeated code that we have

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,440
throughout our application.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,430
So let's say, for instance, one we keep on repeating track catch.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,760
Every time we do an operation, we have the track.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,290
So we'll be looking at putting in code to reduce that and handle errors in a global fashion.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:52,590
Since we really do the same thing almost every time, all the things we'll be looking at will be to

12
00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:00,150
reduce our need for checking certain doing certain checks before we complete certain operations or putting

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,290
in action filters.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,910
We'll also be putting in mechanisms to help speed up the retrieval and processing of data like caching

15
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,660
paging.

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,320
So we'll be looking at all of these things and we'll start off with implementing paging.

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,050
So stay tuned.
