1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,490
All right, guys, so that's another milestone where we're just going to review the things that we implemented

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,330
in this section and then get to our changes to GitHub.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,690
So going in order of what we did, the first one would be paging.

4
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:20,300
So we implemented paging where we post in some were request parameters into our get countries.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,880
And we also went in and said some defaults to see if they don't provide any.

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,180
Then we're going to provide this much information upfront.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,870
Otherwise we give the client the opportunity to say they want this many records.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:40,380
Starting from this point on, they're represented by the number as well as the page.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:40,670
Right.

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,440
So that's one thing that we implemented.

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,590
We also implemented global era handling, which allows us to create or write to our code without the

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,780
need for too many track catches.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,540
And it comes a little bit neater than it was before, where every time we're seeing track catch track.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,360
All right.

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,170
Another thing that we did was implement versioning on our API.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:13,110
So we created this Contrave to controller just for experiment purposes where we specify the API version

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,620
and we explored how we can allow the client to specify which version of the API it is that they want.

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:27,140
And I think the last bit of configuration would have them positive as better.

19
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,410
All right.

20
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,440
So in our extend services we put in still for the exception, handling the global exception, handling

21
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,360
to see, you know, and there's an error log and return with that.

22
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,040
Five hundred for the versioning.

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:49,800
We did say that we want to implement versioning reading from the header being passed in with the request.

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,850
We specify the default API version to be one point or so.

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,700
If money is specified, then it's 1.0.

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:05,580
We also looked at implementing caching so we can actually just provide data for up to a certain amount

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,090
of time before we have to pull the database for the next request.

28
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:15,300
And we also put in validation to make sure that once the underlying data changes that need to kind of

29
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,670
refresh is on top in the cash layer.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,890
And last, but by no means least, we put in throttling to kind of control how often a particular client

31
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,430
based on IP address, at least based on the way we've configured it, can hit a particular endpoint.

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,670
So right now the limit is very small, the period is small, but that's just for our experiment purpose.

33
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:44,460
In our real situation, probably you can look at other providers like Google and so on, and if your

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:52,320
infrastructure is robust enough, you can use their their values to inform you as to how you can put

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,260
in throttling what I leave those examples.

36
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:00,480
What is there for now and what we want to do is check in so we know that we just go over to get changes

37
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,320
and then we put in our message and that is my message.

38
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,270
So when I do this check in, I'll just go ahead and commit and sync.

39
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,640
So everything that I've done here and remember that in the examples of it, I've done it in one place.

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,470
I'd encourage you to try it in the other place.

41
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,980
But then you can always check the source code and double check and compare notes.

42
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:24,200
And once all of that is done, we're ready to move on to our next topic.
