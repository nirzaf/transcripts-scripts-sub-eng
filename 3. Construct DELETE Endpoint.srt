00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome back, guys, in this lesson, we'll be exploring how we delete data through our API, so I've

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,790
already actually created this action, if you want to, can pause and activate it.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,480
So I'm giving you a sneak preview as to what it needs to look like, at least initially.

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,490
The verb is http delete.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,350
We need to let you know that it should expect some parameter in the form of ideas.

6
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,490
An integer, we authorize it.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:37,670
This is another one that you probably want to enforce a rule for administrator because we're deleting.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,880
Otherwise you can just leave it as authorized.

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:48,390
And we know that the response codes here would be four hundred to four and five hundred.

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,230
So you can pause and attempt it and then we can compare notes.

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,300
So what I have in this delete hotel action is a validation to make sure that the ID value makes sense.

12
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,380
That's number one.

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,780
So we do that and then we rejected as a buddy request.

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,090
If it doesn't make sense, then I go on to try.

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:20,570
We know that our catch is already logging and returning US status codes are five hundred.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,650
But then when it tries operation, what it does is it retrieves the hotel with the ID that was passed

17
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,290
and we check if that hotel exists.

18
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:35,040
Otherwise we once again see buddy request and log.

19
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:44,050
The error, otherwise, we go on to delete the photo and see more changes, then return or contents,

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,370
you see there wasn't really much to deleting the hotel.

21
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,950
So the same holds true for the country.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,250
It's pretty much the same method.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,960
We have the delete country with the same statuses.

24
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,380
If you want to extend the same permissions accordingly and we go through, we get the ID, we verify

25
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:11,900
that the volume makes sense and then we try the operation, getting the country validating that it is

26
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,390
not fake number and then going ahead and deleting it.

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,590
If it gets this far, we return and the content of two or four.

28
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,510
So what we want to do is test deleting a hotel versus testing, deleting a country.

29
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,040
And then you're going to see why I'm placing emphasis on those two tests.

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,140
So with the introduction of the delete endpoint, saga gets a bit more colorful.

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,170
You see delete being promoted here.

32
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:49,670
And what we're going to do is use postmen and attempt to delete.

33
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,200
So you have the endpoint.

34
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,220
You know, we need the ID value in the euro.

35
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,910
We're going to choose our verb as delete.

36
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,310
All right, and what I'm going to do is choose a hotel that I really don't want to hurt.

37
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,740
So I think this one this one was just a random test.

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,560
You see, it's still seeing string string, just like the default values that are in the payload example.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
So I'm going to delete hotel with the I.D. number five.

40
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:27,080
So in my delete request, I put in the euro, slash five and then send.

41
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,890
Of course, I need to authorize.

42
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,010
So let me backtrack a bit and try and get a token there would go.

43
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:45,460
All right, here's a token, grab the talk and jump over authorization.

44
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,240
We're talking there we go then and we get to know content.

45
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,790
So if I look back at the list, I shouldn't see the auto side five.

46
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,600
There it is.

47
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,170
It goes further than six.

48
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,440
So five is gone.

49
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,570
No, that is how we would delete a hotel.

50
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:13,090
No, the thing with the country is that the country has hotels, so it's a bit riskier when we delete

51
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,990
a country that we're actually going to have to remove the hotels also.

52
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,750
So let's see what that looks like.

53
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,130
Someone to say country.

54
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:30,520
And looking back, I see that we have two in Cayman and we have that.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,260
So we have one in Bahamas.

56
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,310
So let's try and delete the country of Bahamas.

57
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,110
It only has one or two soldiers bite the bullet and make the sacrifice of that one.

58
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,430
And we can always add it back later on.

59
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:52,720
So what I'm going to do is see a country with these three and go over here.

60
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,890
Put that there, all right, I need three and then send.

61
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:07,050
And we see we're getting a new content, so if I look at the list of countries that we look at, the

62
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,880
list of countries I shouldn't see.

63
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,160
Oh, I deleted.

64
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,690
Come on, that's fine.

65
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,990
So I need Keyman, so, you know, we only have two countries, one and two.

66
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,530
I thought I was deleting Bahamas apologies.

67
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:27,320
So that means none of the hotels that have I'd value three should be there.

68
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,280
So let me send.

69
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,440
And there it is.

70
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:38,990
So we have control with the one country with 80 to control, 31 one, et cetera.

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,990
So no country with ID three remains.

72
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:50,550
And that's because in our migration when we created the database so you can go to the first migration

73
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,650
file, I call the database created, you'll see in the configuration that the constraint on the foreign

74
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,760
key was that it said are differential action, not Kaskade.

75
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:10,830
So Cascade means that if you make any change to the parent meaning country, so you have country being

76
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,170
the parent and hotels are in a country.

77
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,880
So there the children are cards.

78
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:20,460
If you make any change to the country record, it would reflect on the hotels.

79
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,320
So in this case, the change we're making is that we're deleting the parent record.

80
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,760
So it's in undelete.

81
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,330
I want to Kaskade, meaning whatever you do to the parent, replicate that action across the child so

82
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,620
this can actually be changed.

83
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,440
But then you'd have to make the modification in the context file and then run another migration for

84
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,430
it to know that you want no action or to restrict meaning.

85
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,410
And I usually do.

86
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:51,110
I restrict because if there are children records, I don't want to delete the parent.

87
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,730
So that means once there are hotels associated with this country, you cannot believe the country has

88
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,710
what to do.

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,620
However, write notes on Kaskade and like you see when you delete that parent record, it's going to

90
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,660
cascade across all the hotels.

91
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,430
So you have to be careful with that.

92
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:15,210
Make sure that if that configuration obtains in your API, it is deliberate.

93
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,860
That is how you want it to work.

94
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,160
But this is something that can cause massive data loss if it is, if it goes untethered.
