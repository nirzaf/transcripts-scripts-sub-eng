00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,650
Welcome back, guys, in this lesson, we're going to be configuring our course policy, of course,

2
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:15,440
is an acronym for Cross Origin Resource Sharing, and this is just a mechanism that allows you to allow

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,360
or restrict the sharing of resources across domains.

4
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,880
So let me say that in a bit more English.

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:30,470
When somebody who is not on your network tries to access your API by default, your API is going to

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:34,010
reject that access request.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,690
All right.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,800
So if I develop an internal API to be used in my company and somebody from outside my company with a

9
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:49,550
completely different IP address and everything tries to consume the API or talk to the API, then it's

10
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:54,830
going to automatically know that, hey, well, I can't send you any information because I don't know

11
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,020
you.

12
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:05,060
So we want to configure this policy to at least facilitate some conversation with sources are requesters

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,250
that are not necessarily in our network.

14
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,040
All right.

15
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,740
So I've actually run into this before.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,890
I developed an API for my company for third party use, and I spent some time debugging why this company

17
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:23,610
couldn't access the API that was clearly working on my machine and every other machine around me.

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,170
And then after digging, I realized it was the course policy.

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,380
So sometimes you live on, you learn, you learn through experience.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,470
Well, I'm here to just let you know what configurations you can put in place from the get go to kind

21
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,480
of avoid certain busywork.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,890
So in order to add this policy, what we're going to do is in our startup case file and I'm just going

23
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,530
to add to your order does matter to some extent.

24
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,240
But right now we're not really focusing on the order.

25
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:58,010
We just want to get our configurations in someone to see services, not add.

26
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,870
Cause.

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,300
And then I'll just put the semicolon there.

28
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,900
So when we say, of course, we need to add the policy, like CRS needs to know how to behave.

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,230
Right.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,970
So the same way that when we're setting up the other the Swiger, Jen Psaki would say, see?

31
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:23,570
And then they slam the arrow and then we can have multiple lines with multiple configurations.

32
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,870
You could see it within points and so on.

33
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,380
We're going to be doing that here.

34
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,940
So I'm going to see or you can use any tool can really doesn't it could be.

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,190
C could be or it could be the word options.

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,070
Like I said, do you see them using endpoints stone here.

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:47,110
So I just say or and then the lambda arrow and then what I'm going to do is open and close curly braces.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,750
So that means I'm going to have a whole block of configuration.

39
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,290
So I'm just breaking the line so we can see clearly exactly what's what.

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:59,060
And then I'm going to say or not add policy.

41
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:08,320
All right, so I'm adding up policy, then I have to give it a name, so first Burm is the name, I'll

42
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:14,440
just call it cause policy, nothing too fancy or confusing.

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,560
So, of course, policy and then comma.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,000
And then I have to define another lambdas.

45
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,250
I just call this one builder because now I'm going to be building the policy.

46
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,580
So Builder Lambda Arrow and I just break line.

47
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,020
So I going to say builder dot.

48
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,260
Allow any.

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,750
So here are all the options before I start setting them.

50
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,900
These are all the options you can allow any can disallow.

51
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,630
You can sit.

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:57,170
So if it is white listed or with certain headers, you can define whole your API will determine who

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:06,350
is allowed to access me or my resources and who is not for no for an occasional purposes, because later

54
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,610
on maybe we can look at the securing of it and how we mix and match.

55
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,650
But then once again, context is everything.

56
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,850
If you are developing an API for Internet and third party use, then you can't be too strict with the

57
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:22,480
API if ever anybody should be able to get on.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,170
Otherwise, you're going to have an administrative overhead of trying to figure out who is who all the

59
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:27,470
time.

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,030
So I'm just going to say hello.

61
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,980
Any origin.

62
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,760
And I'm just going to chain along alone any method, meaning they can access every method that every

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,910
endpoint that is defined here, and then I'm going to say allow in the header, sorry I any header.

64
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,290
Right.

65
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,650
And then I'll close the briefs for the policy and then use semicolon.

66
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,120
So that's my course policy that's undefined.

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,490
So I'm just allowing every and anybody once you're coming to access my API, you can go ahead and use

68
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,570
the resources.

69
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:15,410
Once again, context is everything that will determine how strict you are with your your course policy.

70
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:23,010
No, after doing all of that, I'm No one to go down to configure and I'm going to let the app know

71
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,280
that it should use the course policy.

72
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:32,280
So right here I'm just going to set up not use cause.

73
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,710
There we go, and then he's going to say, OK, it does some overlord's, I'm going to tell it to the

74
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,650
Palestinians.

75
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,500
And so just by putting the quotation marks, it's an old saying, OK, what's a Palestinian sort of

76
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,450
Palestinian, as I just outlined on top is course policy.

77
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,010
So maybe you could make it a bit more informative.

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,280
You could see a loaf of bread because that's all it's really doing.

79
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:08,680
This policy is allowing someone to say use the policy that says, all right, so that's what the course

80
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,270
policy is really for.

81
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,370
So at this in this situation, we're not going to fully see the benefit of it.

82
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,380
But then if you've done any other project where you have the API and then you have an entirely different

83
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,200
project, which is the client project, which means it is being broadcast, it's a different IP address

84
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,450
than our port than the current API project.

85
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:39,160
Once they try to talk, that will not work until you have this policy in place.
