00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,090
Hey, guys, I want to take this time out to welcome you to this new course, ultimate SB at five Web

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,440
API Development Guide No.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,200
Its title is a mouthful, but I can assure you the contents sort of lives up to the billing.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,870
In this course, you'll learn how to create and maintain maintainable Web API using air speed net five,

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,210
which is the latest and greatest in the Microsoft Development Stock Entity framework.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:30,300
And we will explore many enterprise level design patterns and considerations when it comes to designing

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,020
an API.

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,570
I am your instructor for this course.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
My name is Trevor Williams, I am a software engineer and part time lectures.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:46,630
Now, let's explore what's an API is the letters app and I are short for application programming interface,

11
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,390
pretty much an API is a software interface that acts as an intermediary between two applications.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's say you can access Facebook like functionalities from an app that is not a Facebook app.

13
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:07,180
So this app has to talk to Facebook and allow you to do Facebook like things, whether that is communicating

14
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,960
with Facebook through an API.

15
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,770
So in this course, you will learn how to build that kind of interface to allow persons to access an

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:20,770
underlying data store that we will be building using functionality that we will be building or using

17
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:27,480
clients that they will need to build, whether it's from mobile or web or any other type of device.

18
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:34,360
So APIs or at least the type of API that we will be building are based on the rest principles.

19
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,290
So we will learn, rest and rest assured for representational state transfer.

20
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:45,820
It is a very popular Web API standard and it is across many platforms.

21
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:53,500
So though we will be building the API using the net or the API can be consumed by clients from many

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,600
other developments.

23
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:58,000
That's in addition to this will be learning how to use that.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,290
Natcore five will be looking at how to understand the services and how the whole application still works.

25
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,360
And we'll also be looking at using enterprise level pattern.

26
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,700
So, you know, best practices that we can put into the code such that when we are ready to expand,

27
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:22,180
whether through our own self discovery or in an enterprise setting, we won't have to pull up too much

28
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,010
of our application to do that.

29
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,720
But we can just take on components as we go along.

30
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,590
So in a nutshell, you're going to learn Espie dominated by an entity framework for we're going to be

31
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:39,280
using code first database development and exploring once again key encoding patterns, looking at API

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,060
authentication, using JSON Web tokens or JWT for short, how we can protect and harden our endpoints

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,260
and protect them from unauthorized or unwanted access.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,210
We look at understanding the darknet poor service pipeline and how we can extend them and put in our

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,170
own middleware.

36
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:07,090
We're looking at API testing and logging, so we'll be using Horstmann and Cerillo for our API testing

37
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,100
and logging purposes respectfully.

38
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,220
And we'll also be looking at how Swiger can play a part in documenting our API and also helping with

39
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,110
our testing source control.

40
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,750
We will be using GitHub so that we can securely store our code and be able to roll back should we need

41
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,020
to.

42
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:30,100
And then we look at after building all of these wonderful things, how exactly we allow our API to be

43
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:37,580
accessed, whether in a company setting or by the world know this course has quite a bitterness.

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,430
It's about 10 hours long and you will be learning a lot of things.

45
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,280
So buckle up, get ready for this journey.

46
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,400
And I'm very excited to have you along.
