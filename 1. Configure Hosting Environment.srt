00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey, guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,770
In this lesson, we'll start setting up our environment for a local deployment of our own when we see

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,940
a local deployment, this could easily be your personal machine.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,390
So in my situation, I'll be deploying it on my personal machine.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:23,980
But it could also be on a company machine or a server somewhere that this API needs to serve, you know,

6
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,330
across the network.

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:31,900
And they could potentially even be to the Internet, whatever the situation, teaching you or showing

8
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:39,060
you critical steps towards prepping this machine so that it can host your API.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,850
So our journey starts off here where we have to download the dot net five runtime already of the SDK,

10
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,680
which we've been using for development.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,170
But we want to make sure we have the wrong time and we can just get that hosting bundle for windows.

12
00:00:53,540 --> 00:01:01,120
So when you do that, you launch your installer and then you go ahead and install it, go through security

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,080
checkpoints.

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:10,220
And once that is done, you can close that and then, you know, we're going to move on to something

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,290
else, our Internet information services.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:21,500
So what we want to do is add so you can just go to your start menu and see add feature and then you

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,230
want to click turn Windows features on or off.

18
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,680
So once that is selected, this little box will pop up and you want to make sure that you select Internet

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,000
information services.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,600
Once you do that, you're going to get that square.

21
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,740
That square means that, you know, it's not everything that is ticked, which is fine.

22
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,570
You don't need every single feature.

23
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:46,550
But I'm going to show you the ones that I have currently installed and then you can just go through

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,620
and make sure that those are also on your side.

25
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,940
So I have the management console and then I have these libraries for application development feature.

26
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,860
So you can make sure that you take these off.

27
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,940
Maybe you don't need all of them, but it works for me with these.

28
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,610
So I would recommend that you make sure you have those.

29
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,350
And then for features, you can go ahead and take those.

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,470
Health and diagnostics, once that section is actually optional, but I recommend that you get the logging

31
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,790
section and then performance features basic authentication and others.

32
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,360
So once you have those, you can click, OK, and then it may take a while to install.

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:33,580
I already have them, so I don't need to wait for them to install.

34
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,710
But once they finish installing, then you can resume this video.

35
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:45,720
So once you're sure that you have is or that process is finished to make sure you have so you can just

36
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,860
go to your start menu and type in I guess, and then you'll see it pop up.

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,240
And then when you launch, you get this console showing you your server and all of the sites that you

38
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,690
have currently listed under there.

39
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,100
Right.

40
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,910
To make sure that it's working.

41
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:12,160
You can actually just click on default website and go to browse and then it will show you this page,

42
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,000
which shows you that you're now seeing your server.

43
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:21,280
Now, another essential part of setting up your local environment will be to make sure that your database

44
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,800
server is installed and running.

45
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,940
So when we talk about the database server, we have a few options.

46
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,170
In an enterprise setting.

47
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,070
You probably already have it or you should have it.

48
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,870
You can check with your system administrator whatever you need to do, but you just go ahead and make

49
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:40,450
sure you have a server on a personal level.

50
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,720
If you don't already have it, you have two options.

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,630
You have either developer or express.

52
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,700
So Express is very free, no licensing required at all.

53
00:03:52,210 --> 00:04:00,400
And but then it has some limitations on a personal level versus fine developer gives you far more features

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,260
and it's actually a full poleward.

55
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,960
So it's a much bigger download and a much bigger test to have it installed gives the system many more

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,170
features for this deployment.

57
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,300
You probably can get away with Express, but then maybe if you're thinking about longevity, you probably

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,160
just want to get developers so you have everything you need so you can go ahead and download that.

59
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,700
Insolation is pretty straightforward and at the end of it you be prompted to install the management

60
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,360
studio.

61
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:35,920
And just in case you missed that step, you can always just Google SSME, which is short for Server

62
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,310
Management Studio, and once you go through that, you can always just download a management studio

63
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,440
through this medium also, which is also a straightforward installation.

64
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:53,710
So to launch the management studio after it's installed and to connect to your database server, you

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,790
can go ahead and click the icon and you'll see this splash launching screen and to connect to the server

66
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,260
you love to put in the server name.

67
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:06,940
So I have two servers running on, a few servers running on my machine.

68
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:14,140
Right now I have a skua express, so I do have an instance of Escalon Express, but I also have an instance

69
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,130
of the developer.

70
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:23,710
So to get to Scale Express you can see a dot backslash Eskil Express that that really means localhost

71
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,370
also.

72
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,270
Right.

73
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:31,300
And then if you went to a developer, then you just need localhost so you wouldn't need any special

74
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,110
anything else.

75
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,960
So I'm going to use developer.

76
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,340
So if I say localhost and it will connect and I think of a few databases, not too many.

77
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:47,980
So we can proceed now before we move to the next step, I just want to encourage you make sure that

78
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:54,160
you have admin access or even if you don't have administrative access, if you're in an enterprise setting

79
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,580
where you're not in a position to be the administrator, that you at least have enough access are you

80
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,950
are working with somebody who has the access to carry out some of the actions here.

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,500
So a lot of the problems that people encounter when doing these kind of deployments outside of probably

82
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,680
missing out the library and not installing something, the next biggest issue is usually permissions

83
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,800
and other authorizations.

84
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,090
Right.

85
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,980
So just make sure that you're working with somebody.

86
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,890
If if that is the case, who has enough permissions to go around any potential roadblocks.

87
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,400
And if you're on your personal machine just or a machine that is yours to manage, just make sure that

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,740
you have administrative rights.
