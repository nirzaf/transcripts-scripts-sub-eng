1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,360
Hey, guys, today we're going to get started with installing Visual Studio, Community Edition and

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,390
DOT at five.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,240
Now our journey begins here on the Visual Studio website, which you can get to see through a simple

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,960
Google search.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:20,240
Or you can try to reproduce this URL, which is Visual Studio, dot Microsoft, dot com slash, VSS

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,490
slash community.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:28,290
Now there are different editions of Visual Studio and community is the one that is free for individual

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,360
use and that's the one that we will use.

9
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:35,940
So you can go ahead and download Visual Studio, which will give you the visual studio installer.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,910
And once that is completed, you can go ahead and run that file, go through in the security check points

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,500
that you might have, but you may proceed to allow the installer to begin.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,580
Now, this is where you actually define what Visual Studio will be capable of.

13
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,430
So these are called workload's.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,010
And each workload will expose a different feature set to do so for Web development.

15
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:04,290
You want to get the speed on it and web development workload for desktop development.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,960
You want to get the desktop development workload.

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:14,040
And for any other SDK or type of project that you may want to develop, you can go ahead and get the

18
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,400
workload associated with it.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,480
For this exercise.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,430
You want to prepare our visual studio with the necessary resources for web development.

21
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,720
Once again, you can go ahead and take as many of these workflows.

22
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:33,150
Each one will come with its own size and it tells you how much space is required based on the ones that

23
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,920
you select.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,660
But at minimum, for Web development, you want to make sure you have speed on that and web development.

25
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,580
You can go ahead and take the other development tools if you wish.

26
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:50,280
But I'm not going to do that because these are all dot net framework six and four and four point eight

27
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,980
four point sixty four point seven and four point eight.

28
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,220
But we're going to be installing dot net five in a few minutes so you can go ahead and do this and let

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,780
Visual Studio install.

30
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,890
This will take a while so you can grab a cup of coffee and come back.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,990
No ones that don't load and installation is completed.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,900
You have two options.

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,410
You can go ahead and sign in and sign in, meaning you sign in with your life account if you have one.

34
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,180
If not, then you go ahead and create one.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,130
It's free and it makes life easier if you just create one and actually sign in.

36
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,580
But I'll just go ahead with the not no maybe later option and then you choose your general settings.

37
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,430
So I like the dark theme and you can choose who they want web development settings or general, I'll

38
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,400
just leave mine on General even though we are doing web development.

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,270
But they basically just optimized certain keyboard shortcuts and the layout based on your selection

40
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,620
of Lieberman in general.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,500
And I'll start with Visual Studio.

42
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:50,970
All right.

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,520
So once that is done, you're going to be prompted with this, though.

44
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,150
If you don't get this, then that's fine.

45
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:04,650
But here is why I would have suggested that you sign in with your life accounts because you you have

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,900
a 30 day trial period.

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,950
And if you don't have the account, then they'll basically just tell you to exit.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,220
So you can actually just go ahead and sign in.

49
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,660
So I'm just going to sign in with my own.

50
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,570
And once you have signed it and then you'll see that it is not licensed to you and it just looks a bit

51
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,350
more inviting.

52
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,170
So now, instead of exiting Visual Studio, I can close.

53
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,610
And this is Visual Studio at the very basic level.

54
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,440
Now we have Visual Studio.

55
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,190
What we also need is Daughton at five so you can get to the dot net five download page through a simple

56
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,660
Google search once again.

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,240
Or you try to reproduce this.

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,470
You are whichever one you find easier to do at this point.

59
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,080
You want to download the SDK and the runtime.

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,800
So let me start by closing Visual Studio because it need to install extensions for it and the installer

61
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,500
is always available for you.

62
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,140
So if you fail to add a workload, just so you know, you can actually just click modify and then it

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,690
will relaunch that page with all the workload.

64
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:12,090
So if later on you wanted to do something new, you just need to modify, get that workload and then

65
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,480
you will get those project templates accordingly.

66
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,010
I'm going to close with the studio, however, so we can continue with our installation, so we'll get

67
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,110
the dominant five.

68
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,990
No, you can see that the SDK is available based on your OS.

69
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:32,280
I have Windows 64 bit OS working with right now, so I'll go ahead and download that and why that one

70
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,940
is downloading.

71
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:40,650
I'm just going to hit the mark button and go over to the runtime, which is absolutely necessary for

72
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,740
hosting to see the ICE runtime support.

73
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,970
So if you're going to be hosting the net five application on a local server, then you definitely need

74
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:56,220
the runtime so you can just get this hosting bundle that they have there available for download.

75
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,850
So you can just download both and when they're both finished.

76
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,530
So when the SDK is finished, you can go ahead and install that one first.

77
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,300
It shouldn't take too long.

78
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:14,310
And OK, so it's successful after we've installed the SDK, then we want to just make sure that we have

79
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:21,390
the runtime also agree to anything and go ahead and ruin your installation and it will let you know

80
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,820
when it is successfully completed now that we have the SDK is completely installed.

81
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,220
I just want to launch Visual Studio and show you what you get with those SDK.

82
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,550
So if I go ahead and create a brand new project.

83
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:41,740
Because of the workload's that I have available to me, I will see different project templates, so

84
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,980
I own the tool is the Web workload, so I have the ability to do a regular console up.

85
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,320
I have the speed on it core.

86
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,200
As a matter of fact, I think that this one comes because of the desktop work load.

87
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,030
But at this point I'm not trying to figure out which workload belongs to which.

88
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:04,990
I just know that if you are going to be doing a Web project, you have the option to choose your Web

89
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:13,240
application, a blazer application, and you can choose them with a core or dot net framework, someone

90
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,640
to choose a core Web application.

91
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,140
This is not the actual application that we're building.

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,540
I'm just showing you your options when we go ahead, put the project name to create.

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,240
Then from the dropdown list here, you can choose whether you want to core two point one or three point

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,650
one or the latest dot Natcore five point or and with that, you will be able to choose the different

95
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,950
templates and proceed.

96
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:44,620
So when we come back, we'll actually create a project and do a tour of the folder structures.
