00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,450
Hey, guys, in this video will be creating or Microsoft as your accounts, like I said earlier, we

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,890
can get started for free to get to this website.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,690
We go to Azor Dot Microsoft dot com.

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,580
And then I guess the road to according to your reason or your language.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,800
But this is what the website looks or should look like.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,620
And you can read through it to see exactly what Asgeir is all about.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:34,650
It's about being futuristic, allowing more collaboration and operating more seamlessly in a cloud space

8
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:40,660
where there are all over the world and you usually would just choose the region that is closest to you.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:50,280
So I'm actually in the Caribbean region, so my closest region is east to us or east us too.

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,590
But that's not for this video.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:53,700
This video.

12
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,110
We're just creating the O'Collins.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,960
We're not setting up anything about regions just yet.

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,290
So to get started, we can just well, if you have a live account already, then you can just go ahead

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,010
and send in with that live account where you can just click start free.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,460
And here they tell you that you can create a free going to be and you can get started with 12 months

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,460
of free services.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,270
So that's a good deal to me.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,430
And if you scroll down, you'll see 12 months of free, popular free services, plus two hundred dollars

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,110
credits, which will expire in 30 days.

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,880
So they give it 200 dollars so you can create V virtual machines, you can create resources in the cloud

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,070
and experiment until that money is up.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,140
And that's really just for one month.

24
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,550
But then there are certain services that you just get for free for the rest of the year and then you

25
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,040
have a few other services that are always free.

26
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,140
So what we're going to do is just go ahead and click, start free.

27
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,260
And then they'll ask us to sign in with our live accounts.

28
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,170
If you have a live account once again, you can go ahead and use that.

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,340
If you don't have an account, then you can go ahead and create one.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,280
And this is a very recent option to sign in with GitHub.

31
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:15,970
So I have a live account that I use, but I'm just going to walk you through the create one first.

32
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:21,230
No, the Levaquin doesn't necessarily have to be at livor at all.

33
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,340
It doesn't have to be a traditional Hotmail account.

34
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,780
It can be a Gmail account.

35
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,800
So I can actually use maybe the same email address I used for getable or email addresses I use when

36
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,930
I'm signing up for things I can use that, whether it's Yahoo, Gmail, Hotmail or whatever it is,

37
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,370
and just click next.

38
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:45,200
And here it's it's telling me that I already have a Microsoft icon.

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,430
So that's just driving.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:53,720
My point, though, that once you have an account, an email address, it doesn't have to be a hot meal

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,260
or a traditional Levaquin, but they are just creating a Microsoft account for you with that email address

42
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,550
so you can go ahead and sign up.

43
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,050
It's a pretty straightforward process.

44
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,930
The account that they said already existed.

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,740
That's an account I was using to sign up for the free account.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,530
So I actually just went ahead and logged in.

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:21,380
And because I really didn't setup much more, I think that your registration process is actually going

48
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,410
to look very similar to this regardless.

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,500
So on to get over the hurdle of putting in your email address and proceeding, then you're probably

50
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,380
going to end up on a screen like this where you're going to be asked for your demographic information.

51
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,670
Just for the record, keeping my country and region is Jamaica and I'm putting in my phone number that

52
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:44,450
I treat next.

53
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,640
And then they say, do you want to verify your identity by phone or do you want to buy a card or someone

54
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,420
to choose?

55
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,710
Takes me by phone and I just got the text.

56
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,210
It didn't take long at all.

57
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,410
So I'm just going to put in the code and then verify.

58
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,560
Now, here's the part that might deter you if you're not prepared for it.

59
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:15,770
They will want to verify your identity by card so you won't be charged unless you upgrade, meaning

60
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
they have different OILCLOTH subscription plans.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
So you're signing up for the free subscription plan.

62
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:29,300
Once that free subscription plan is done, then you won't be able to do much on the platform until you

63
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,690
sign up for a new subscription plan which coincides that upgrade.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,610
So like I said earlier, there is pay as you go and then there's pay as you go test, which is the one

65
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,240
item on which is like half the price of the regular pay as you go.

66
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,590
So I actually provided my card information when I signed up.

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,760
And having done that, you can make an agreement.

68
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,950
If you don't have a card or you're not comfortable with providing your card details, then I mean,

69
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,000
you can stop here.

70
00:04:59,010 --> 00:04:59,710
That's fine.

71
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:05,390
Later on, when we're actually deploying to as you can still see what it will look like and see how

72
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,650
beneficial it is to you.

73
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:13,730
But if you wish, then you can go ahead and provide your information and then click on the agreement

74
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:18,800
and accept the agreement terms and then you would be in on the platform.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,010
So I'm just going to sign into my real account, my quote unquote relection, the one that I use, and

76
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,450
show you what a zero looks like.

77
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,660
Well, actually, I just stepped in portable dot as dot com, hoping that you would ask me to log in,

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,510
but I did that and they just rewrote me using the same icon that I was just setting up toward Williams

79
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,680
at G.M. dot com.

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,290
So this dashboard.

81
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,330
So this is the Azura dashboard.

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,740
That's a very basic level.

83
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,350
They have a panel to the side here listing out quite a few services that you can get.

84
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,750
But then because we didn't complete this little boy, because I didn't complete the setup, at least

85
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,280
then when I go to subscriptions, I'm going to see that I have no subscription.

86
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,840
So like I will see in the subscription is how they treat you as a customer, whether Europe as you go

87
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,660
enterprise or whatever.

88
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:18,360
So if I later on decide that I want to provide my information, I can just come back and click add and

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,380
then that will bring me to complete the Senate procedure where I actually add the subscription.

90
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,990
So this is a free trial, one that we're setting up just now.

91
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,420
As you go.

92
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,390
You have developer support as you have quite a few of them.

93
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:33,790
All right.

94
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,090
So I would probably go with pay as you go, but that that's yeah.

95
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:49,380
This is all in the in the steps of signing up for Azor, and that is if you wish to proceed with that.

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,010
But then for this detour, really and truly, I just wanted you to get as far as the dashboard so that

97
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,950
you can see that this is what a zero looks like.

98
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,750
This is really workload management, portelli against against your virtual machines.

99
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,060
But for this course, we'll be looking at up services.
