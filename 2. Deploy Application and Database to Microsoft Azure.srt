1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,770
You guys will come back, so we already settle for Azura cones and all we want to actually deploy.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,390
So before I do that, though, I want to make a slight configuration change to where our files will

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:18,550
be going, because in Asgeir, there is no CGI, there's no local draft.

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,820
So what I wanted to do is let Cerillo create a folder within the whole folder structure for the project,

5
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:32,240
and that's where the logs will be written so that when we go to Azor, we don't have to worry about

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,460
any file path or get to fancy.

7
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:42,340
So let's go over and publish now, that being said, I'm just doing this locally for simplicity.

8
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:50,380
There are tons of more outlets that I see a robust logging mechanisms that we can take advantage of.

9
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:56,070
I'm just doing this because I want to find the most cost effectively, because the other ones cost money

10
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,040
as you add on.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,710
Or so, let's just go to publish and we're going to set up a new publisher.

12
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,410
So I already have a published profile for local deployment, which is a Holeproof.

13
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:08,860
Right.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,490
So I can actually just rename this one so I know exactly what it is for its profile safe.

15
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,000
All right.

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,440
Well, then I want a new one.

17
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,020
And this one is going to be the Azira profile.

18
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:28,480
So what I want to do is deploy to one Azura up service, know if you if you don't know that much about

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,830
Osram cloud, what happens is that you can deploy an application as us on an application, as a service

20
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,500
kind of constraint, meaning you don't have to worry about the server or anything, just like a nice

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,030
container for you and put your code there and then they will host it.

22
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,830
And that's where you get like a SAS, right.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,420
Or rather, that would be the services platform as a service.

24
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,090
So they're providing the platform as a service for you to just put your app on it and it will just run.

25
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,770
So that's what they mean by the service.

26
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,150
And then what they want to buy a Windows or Linux, we'll use Windows.

27
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,660
Otherwise you can do it a container or to a container industry or to a virtual machine.

28
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,900
So basically the same kind of considerations that would have made with its deployment to either your

29
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,060
machine or a network machine.

30
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,220
You would have to do those kind of considerations against a VM in Azure because it's the same thing

31
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,450
as just a virtual machine CRM server and a whole will to choose the platform as a service, the service

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
and then click next.

33
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:42,310
And then this will, though it may prompt you to get connected, so you'll have to sign in order to

34
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,880
send in.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,360
So it just for me, it shows you the subscription resource group and I don't have any of those.

36
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:55,050
So I'm just going to go ahead and press this plus sign to start building up services.

37
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,520
They ask for the name, I'm not going to change the name.

38
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:05,080
And then I have a few resource groups here from past projects, but I'm going to create a brand new

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,410
one.

40
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,540
I'm going to call it Hotel Listing API.

41
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:18,640
So that's the name of that resource group and then the hosting plan here, I can leave it on the default,

42
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,610
but then they do have a free hosting plan.

43
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:28,200
And based on where I am in the world, e US two is my best bet and I choose free.

44
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,700
So you might be somewhere else in the world.

45
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,760
You choose the region that's closest to you.

46
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:38,080
But based on where I am, EastWest is my region of choice.

47
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,720
Now choose the free deployment.

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,590
Click okay.

49
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,410
And then create.

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:51,880
And then after that process is done we can go ahead and click next and then we can refresh.

51
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,740
No apologies, this management, so I don't want any management, I just skip this step and then we

52
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:57,980
click.

53
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,460
So the next screen you're showing us what our side you are is going to be.

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,380
So whatever the OP name is that we sit there that Dot Azera websites dot net because it's free, they

55
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:15,170
give us a subdomain and we can always go ahead and buy our own domain if we want, but we won't get

56
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,010
that far ahead.

57
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,880
But because we do have a service dependency on a database, they're seeing what they need to configure

58
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,500
your database for connectivity purposes.

59
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,750
Right.

60
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,490
So I need to go and configure and then they'll ask us, do we want an on premises secure server database

61
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,780
or will it be easier?

62
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,720
So once again, we'll go with the POS option where they are just giving us a service in the cloud and

63
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,770
we just need to connect.

64
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:49,470
So we have to go ahead and create a brand new instance of a database service hosting Nemoto Service

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,590
Stevic kind of fill out some things.

66
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,780
I'm going to put it in the same resource group as the Hotel Listing API.

67
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,840
There we go.

68
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
And then database server.

69
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,250
I have to create a new one.

70
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,700
So it will kind of fill out some things, but I'm going to have to put in my administrative details.

71
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,770
So and the password part of it is relatively strict.

72
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,320
So just make sure you have a special card and a capital letter and a number and you should be fine once

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,730
you exceed seven characters.

74
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:26,240
So once you put in all of those details, you can go ahead and call it autofill, what it needs to fill,

75
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:33,770
but then it does need to, one, create the database server and then you would have access to connect

76
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,160
to it.

77
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,690
Right.

78
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,450
And that is completed.

79
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:40,490
So let's just go click next.

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,100
And then what it will do is say, OK, this is the database connection string name.

81
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,800
What is the user name?

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,670
So we have to put back the user name that we just use to create the database stuff and the password.

83
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,060
And then it will keep it in the Azor upsetting section.

84
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:05,630
We can choose the Kevo, but I'll just leave that as the default settings there.

85
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:14,090
And then if we want, we can actually view the connection string value so I can actually show you guys

86
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,390
that.

87
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:21,260
So the datasource this is the connection to the actual database in Azura, right.

88
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:28,130
So if I just copy that just for my own purposes, then it shows the initial catalog.

89
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,210
That's the database name.

90
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:36,380
The user I.D. will be travois at that, that whatever that domain and the password.

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,270
I use a simple password, of course.

92
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,260
And I realized that you use a more secure password so that we can just go ahead and click next and we

93
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,110
don't have to touch anything here and just say finish.

94
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,820
All right.

95
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,520
And now we can click publish.

96
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:59,350
And this might take a while because it has to create a few resources.

97
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,430
And this is seeing your publishing the application without bundling the runtime, checking the runtime

98
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:08,250
compatibility so we can give that to the end result of that check.

99
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,770
However, is it launching the browser and sending me this five hundred error or so at least we know

100
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,720
that it is responding.

101
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,960
So the API is there, but we still have a few things that we need to do.

102
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,670
So let's start off by going to our portal.

103
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,640
So only just manage in a zero portal.

104
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,340
We get navigates into this page showing us the application running as your art.

105
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,950
So we know it's definitely not Adelita, it's there.

106
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,210
We click brose.

107
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:45,950
It's going to show us the Yurok are protected by GPS and we're getting by that five hundred.

108
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,530
So we're not we're not any better off than we were before, but at least we can confirm a few things.

109
00:07:52,040 --> 00:08:00,880
No, if we go down to configuration it will kind of show us some of the things like our connection string.

110
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:01,660
Right.

111
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:06,980
Or remember that connection string and that hidden value, at least from this connection string.

112
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:12,170
I can see the server for the database, so I'm just going to copy that.

113
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,140
Remember I showed you earlier, so I'm just going to copy that.

114
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:21,850
And then in the management studio, I'm going to try and connect to it's just going to click that plug.

115
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,660
If he already had it open, that's fine.

116
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:30,200
If not, then you launch a management studio and then you put in the server name and whatever credentials

117
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,580
were there and click connect.

118
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,050
And it will just promptly to.

119
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:39,680
And so what happens is that the firewall is seeing I'm not allowing access to the database from any

120
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,720
other source that's outside of us.

121
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,850
You're so right.

122
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:50,480
Know, what I want to do is just sign in and then it will add an exception for the IP address that I

123
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,200
am using.

124
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,150
So that's an important security feature.

125
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,480
So I will be behind this IP address.

126
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,010
Somebody from their own home with a different IP address won't be able to get to the database unless

127
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:03,440
they sign in and verified, just like I'm doing now.

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,510
So I'll just go ahead and click, OK?

129
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,380
Of course there are ways to allow access from everywhere, but we don't need to do that right now.

130
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,320
And then when I look in the list of databases, we see our database.

131
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,090
I'm just confirming that our database is.

132
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,800
But look at this.

133
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,030
There are no tables.

134
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,880
And what I'm going to do is edit the profile and go to settings.

135
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,420
And we actually skipped this step.

136
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:32,400
I guess we're too eager, right?

137
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,920
So we did not do the migration steps, apply this migration on publish and we already use their own

138
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,870
the connection stream with the new Tostin database at runtime.

139
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,930
So that's not really necessary to take again.

140
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,130
But that's fine.

141
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,330
And I'll see even that.

142
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,890
I just click publish again.

143
00:09:52,550 --> 00:10:00,110
And if we just look at the log, you see adding database and then you see here, it gives us the some

144
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,720
indication of some scripting happening.

145
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,010
So let's double check.

146
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,550
And what happens this time around is that because we said apply the migration's it's actually went ahead

147
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,580
and filled all the tables for us.

148
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:13,890
Right.

149
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,220
So that's the real important part of it.

150
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,560
So we didn't have to manually the script.

151
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:28,220
But once again, it would be prudent of you in our real production life scenario to control this process

152
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:33,740
a bit more than we can do on our personal projects and in our personal time.

153
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:34,630
All right.

154
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,940
So you can check them out, of course, on deploying on controlling production in the environments.

155
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:46,370
But for this, we're just we just want to get our API open running and understand all the systems work

156
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:46,760
together.

157
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,970
So this is our database currently functioning on our as your server.

158
00:10:54,510 --> 00:11:01,230
So let's go back to our consulate instead of Koutou, go to the side of the road and then remember that

159
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,600
we said put the love at the same root as a filesystem.

160
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:11,790
So that's why we have access to our loved folder right here, which will show us our log since we've

161
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,510
been doing this deployment.

162
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,550
So if I just go ahead and download, it will open it up in a new browser session.

163
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,390
And I just want to see why it through the most recent error.

164
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:30,120
So it says something went wrong with the argument, not the exception, some strong reference error

165
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:37,840
and some encoding that is supposed to be happening in service extensions, line forty six.

166
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,550
So if we just go and look at the code and see what exactly is happening on that line, it is where we're

167
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:50,610
configuring our JWT and you see that we're doing all of this and this is where it says the encoding

168
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:57,540
failed and it failed because we're looking for key and key is really an environment variable called

169
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:57,910
key.

170
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,230
So remember that we just had to set.

171
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,330
That'll be nice.

172
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,260
We have to do the same thing as you're right.

173
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:13,800
So what I'm going to do is go back to our management dashboard, go down to configuration, and then

174
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,770
from here I can see a new application sitting.

175
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,450
So I'm going to see a new application.

176
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,570
Setting is key along with the values.

177
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,410
So, I mean, I can continue to use that same value.

178
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,150
I'm going to probably just use a simpler value.

179
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,780
But then for consistency between the environments, you probably want the same thing.

180
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,880
So it's, you know, one or the other.

181
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:38,850
They use a simpler one in dev bodies, a complicated one in production, or you use one part environment.

182
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,060
So for, you know, security and separation of roles, situations, a developer might not be able to

183
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,650
just go into production and manipulate anything because he probably doesn't know.

184
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,420
But for simplicity, I'm just going to keep the same key across.

185
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,370
And I click, OK, go ahead and save that continue.

186
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,250
And it will it will say it will restart the application.

187
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:02,910
That's fine.

188
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:04,800
Go ahead and restart.

189
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,740
And once that is restarted, I'm going to go to over if you go to Brose.

190
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,260
All right.

191
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,420
So we know that we can't brose anywhere.

192
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,440
We're getting this.

193
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,440
So at least we're not getting a five hundred.

194
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,280
This is the same error that we've got.

195
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:20,430
If you went through the highest deployment, that's what we got when we went to the root.

196
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:29,010
So if I say slash Swagga, then it will lead me to the Swagga doc being hosted on our as your website.

197
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,670
Then I'm just going to go ahead and do a quick test.

198
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:37,680
So I'm going to try to get the countries execute.

199
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,860
And then I have successfully retrieved all of the countries currently in the database.

200
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:51,480
So that means if I tried to use post one, I'm just going to copy this URL, go over to Postman and

201
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,810
I'm just going to create a new workspace because sometimes you can overcrowd one.

202
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,380
So I'm just going to create a new workspace.

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,350
Called it as your.

204
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,890
And then what I'm going to do over here is just do all my azure related requests.

205
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:11,240
So country I want to get there's no authorisation tag.

206
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:17,820
But then as you can see, you can get all the countries right off the bat through this.

207
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:26,260
Let's try one of those registration items and then to to do something that is secure.

208
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,610
So I'm just going to be flipping between the original workspace where I had the requests already and

209
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,420
this new one.

210
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,240
So I'll just go over to the post.

211
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,170
I just copy this and instead of bothering you with creating it, I just did it.

212
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:47,790
So the new endpoint would be whatever the website name is, Slash and then API.

213
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,840
So that's why I didn't remove it since the Iast deployment.

214
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,120
I left it because it makes more sense here.

215
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,320
Write a column, slash log in and then we can send and I got an error because I had the login payload

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,690
instead of the register payload.

217
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:04,550
So I apologise.

218
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,350
So we're doing our register and we have the cart payload with the email password and this is the same

219
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:13,230
one that we tested with from when we're on our local.

220
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:20,280
So I just want to verify that everything still works as it works and we get our tool to accept it.

221
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,090
So that's good.

222
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,110
We're on the right track.

223
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,220
So what I can do is repeat the login request.

224
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:33,870
So I just click that, bring about the login request and then we can send get our token.

225
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,950
Excellent.

226
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,140
And then what we'll do is attempt the delete our creation or something that we know.

227
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,530
We had said that one of those authorized and of course I'm not bothering you with forming the link,

228
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,940
but you know that you have to form the link properly.

229
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,470
The endpoint is API slash photo with the ID.

230
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:53,700
It's the delete.

231
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:59,980
I thought and then we add our authorization, betoken and the token that we just got about from the

232
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:06,450
log in and then when we clicks we retrieve our tool for no content response.

233
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:14,410
So if I go to the database just to verify once again our Azor database, we can verify that we no longer

234
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,720
have a photo with the ID three.

235
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:24,310
So we know that we can register user to our No publicly deployed API.

236
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:30,760
So if I made this link any more, any easier to remember than you could actually browse through it.

237
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,110
Granted, by the time you're doing this, listen, this probably no longer exists.

238
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:40,150
But the point is that this is all you can publish your API to the world.

239
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:47,410
And using slogger, you made it easy for anybody to be able to come by and say, oh, that is how this

240
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,840
endpoint works and these are all of those.

241
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:55,030
And you see that we retained our country V two for, you know, and we're talking about versioning,

242
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,020
our APIs.

243
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,930
We retain the weather forecast default API.

244
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,410
But of course, no, we can clean up all of those things.

245
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:08,170
And some cleanup's that I would suggest would be like with country and hotel, really and truly, I

246
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,070
should have called it the endpoints, countries and hotels.

247
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:17,530
So the controllers really should have been countries controller and hotels controller.

248
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:19,410
But that's semantics.

249
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,940
That's just a matter of presentation.

250
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,630
At this point.

251
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,250
We can confirm that our functionality is up and running.
