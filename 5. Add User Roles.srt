1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:01,730
Hey, guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:09,580
So one very important parts of user authorization is knowing what role this users in appointing, though

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,260
we haven't done anything associated with roles who are more preoccupied with getting the user information,

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,080
validating it and whether we create the user or not.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,240
Now, when it comes to rules, the rules that are allowed need to exist in the system prior to the system

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,930
being used.

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:34,880
So the same way that we would have set up these operations for hotels and countries of less importance

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,130
really than rules would be.

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,650
So we want to make sure that the rules are there from the get go so that when the users start registering,

10
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,540
the rules are already there.

11
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,690
So what we want to do is see them.

12
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,670
But instead of ceding them the way that we see the country and who, I'm going to show you the way that

13
00:00:52,670 --> 00:01:00,260
we can obstruct that operation from our DB contacts and keep the BB context as light as possible, similar

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:05,780
to what I need to do that with our services that we are installing.

15
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,720
So what I'm going to do is set up a new folder.

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,270
I have configurations or that I'm just going to go ahead and add another folder inside that that I'm

17
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,590
going to call entities.

18
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,340
So configurations for anything that is entity related and then I'm going to add a class and then I want

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,380
to call this class roll configuration, go ahead and add it.

20
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,450
And then this rule configuration class is inheriting from entity.

21
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,240
Type configuration.

22
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,670
And it will be of the type identity role.

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,920
All right, go ahead and include any missing references.

24
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,690
So we're just listing rule configuration, all that.

25
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,280
It's going to be associated with that configuration type.

26
00:01:54,290 --> 00:02:00,730
And of course, we have to go ahead and implement whatever this is seeing needs to be implemented,

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,700
which is our configure function or so it's automatically going to pass or the same builder that is in

28
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,000
use on model creating.

29
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:22,390
So then we can actually replicate the code that we have where we say builder DOT has data.

30
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:34,030
And then instead of building the test data, we can go ahead and create new rules, new rule objects.

31
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,550
So let me just sort of these quotation marks.

32
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,600
All right.

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,150
So a new identity rule.

34
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,750
And we're just going to initialize this object.

35
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:53,260
I'm not going to give it an idea, it was sort of an ad, but the name that's called this one user.

36
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,120
And we have to give it a normalized name, which is really just capitalized version of that.

37
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:07,430
The of the name, really, and then I'm also going to give it.

38
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,570
Administrator, hospital administrator.

39
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:23,130
And then the normalized is all caps version of the ministry or ministry.

40
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,950
So always make sure the spending is right.

41
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,090
I've spent these debugging but spilling, so don't be like me.

42
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,440
All right.

43
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,260
So now that we have this configured method and as many rules as you think you may need, you can go

44
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,510
ahead and configure them.

45
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:44,570
But the most important parts of all of that is when we're ready to put it into the system.

46
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,550
We need only say builder.

47
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,590
Not apply.

48
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:03,210
Sorry, Bill Der not apply configuration, and then I'm just going to see a new role.

49
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,650
Configuration.

50
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,650
And then include the missing reference store you created and there we go.

51
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,290
So you see, that looks much to me that looks much neater than having all of this in this file.

52
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:28,090
Remember that the reason we moved it from the top here above the list was that it was so huge a function

53
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:29,620
because of all these lines.

54
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:37,090
So if you want, you can pause right now and attempt to build other configuration files for country

55
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,990
and hotel.

56
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,370
All right, so I hope you actually attempted it because I did it right, so I'm not going to ask you

57
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,030
to do anything.

58
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm not going to do so just in case you need some guidance.

59
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,030
We I went ahead and created configuration files per type.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:55,770
All right.

61
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,570
So we have hotel and we have country and we have rules.

62
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,160
So we created a all together.

63
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,270
I did country.

64
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,980
Same name.

65
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,410
Basically, you could copy and paste according to the essential parts control configuration that I into

66
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:15,460
the type configuration relative to country as a contextless and then the same code that was there to

67
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,360
create the country's.

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
I just cut and paste.

69
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,690
All right.

70
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:26,500
The only thing is that in the previous one we had builder dot entity, something like that, and I removed

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,730
that DOT entity part.

72
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,350
So it's just builder that has data.

73
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:36,220
So you can go ahead and replicate that across both country and hotel.

74
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:41,920
And if you're doing your own thing across any other one, I know you're on model building looks much

75
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:42,670
cleaner.

76
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,330
Right.

77
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,450
And I think I just put this one.

78
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,640
I don't really think it matters where in terms of order, but I just put it on the bottom since that's

79
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,340
the order in which everything was being created anyway.

80
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,170
So country then hotel, then we have the rules once again.

81
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:05,840
These two are really optional in terms of what's really needed to get the application up and running.

82
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,160
Right.

83
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,440
So now that we have the rule configuration or seating, we can all just add migration and see added

84
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,540
default rules.

85
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:25,830
And that and the resulting migration file has two entries into our rules file.

86
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,820
So you see generated its own ID.

87
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,670
That's why I didn't bother to modify that.

88
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,980
But then we get user and we get administrator.

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,610
So when we do update database, it will go ahead and do the insert.

90
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,640
So once that is done, we have two other changes to make.

91
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,160
So one is in the user D to introduce this collection of type string and I'm calling its rolls.

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:50,870
Right.

93
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,950
So we're giving the user the opportunity to see which rule or rules should this person have.

94
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:57,940
Right.

95
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,520
And then in the account controller.

96
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:09,740
Right after we have vetted if the registration attempt was successful or not, are the user creation

97
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,240
operation was successful or not run, remember, if it gets beyond that is a statement, it means that

98
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,210
it was successful.

99
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:24,170
Then we take the extra step of seeing user manager that not add rules async and we're adding to the

100
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,010
user that was just created the role that came in our rules that came in.

101
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:39,040
So if you look at this, it has a few overrides, one over it allows it to or not over the overload.

102
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,550
Sorry.

103
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:46,010
So the one overload allows you to just passing in a list of rules that it will just go ahead and add

104
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,900
to this user.

105
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,300
So once the rule exists, then it will be associated with the user in the bucket once again, built

106
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,370
in function, not much code or if needed on our part.

107
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,070
So let us do this for a spin.

108
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,610
So in Swagga, you see that they are modifying the potential values, right, so that they are showing

109
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,280
that they can pass in an area called rules.

110
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,540
So the area is the square brackets, whereas an object is occurring.

111
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,580
So let's try it out.

112
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:20,060
And I'm going to leave this same user as the same user that we've got success with last time.

113
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,120
Right.

114
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,970
So that means I should get some validation message to see it shouldn't work, but I'm going to pass

115
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,890
in the role of user and when they execute and then here's what I'm getting.

116
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,600
So the result is that I have a 400 board request.

117
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,880
Duplicate email is the issue.

118
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,930
It's already taken.

119
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,880
So that validation is working.

120
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:52,930
So let's see, user at hotels, hotel listing, dot com does something different and that's the user.

121
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,450
So I'll go ahead and execute.

122
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,140
And what I'm getting is not a bad response.

123
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:00,800
All right.

124
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,600
That looks good.

125
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,990
So let's us see what happened in the database after those operations.

126
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,170
So I'm going to kill the execution, go over to the server manager and first, then want to look into

127
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:19,020
user status, I should have at least two users based on my tests so far, and they will go away.

128
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,350
I use a total listing and user at example.

129
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,220
All right.

130
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,050
So that's good.

131
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,030
The next one would be the rolls.

132
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,920
So I just scaffolded the rules myself.

133
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,030
I just see that the rules.

134
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,040
And so these other rules that we created.

135
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,720
However, the User Roll Association is stored here because it's a many to many.

136
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,960
So they're seeing that many users rights have many rules.

137
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,700
Right.

138
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,060
So that's why we allowed Honoria, because maybe one user might be administrator and user, maybe and

139
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,440
supervisor etc, etc. based on this system, it's all context.

140
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:55,710
Right.

141
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:03,060
However, in this table, when we view data, then we should see the user ID associated with the roll.

142
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,440
Right.

143
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:04,770
Right.

144
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,600
So if we were to just go back and double check, you see that this is the user ID.

145
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,870
There was no ending eight F seven.

146
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,890
So if I look at that same user ID and if seven and the rules seven, five, five.

147
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,380
So you have to go to this one to see which one is seven five five which is user.

148
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,290
So that is all.

149
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:33,930
We start integrating rules based authorization into our systems and all our users when they get registered,

150
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,200
will get registered with their appropriate rules.
