1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,530
Welcome back, guys.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,430
We're continuing our API development journey and we'll be exploring the put verb at this time.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:18,030
Now, put is similar to the post, except it is mainly used to either create if it doesn't exist or

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,580
update if it does exist.

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,860
So let's get started and when we tested you, that will make a bit more sense to you.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,140
So the first thing that I would want to do is to replicate the kind of restriction as to who can access

7
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,090
the to me.

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:38,020
If you can't create, then you shouldn't be able to update it.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,470
Once again, context rules.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,460
But I'm just going to authorize and I'm just going to authorize.

11
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,080
I'm not even going to make it rule based.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,380
Right.

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,180
So the administrator can create.

14
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,910
But then once you're authorized, you can go ahead and create.

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,400
You can go ahead and update.

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,380
Sorry, regardless of your role.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,250
All right.

18
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,180
So the next one would be HTP put.

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:02,590
That is our new verb.

20
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:11,840
And more or less, we're going to have the same return codes except be doing something differently for

21
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,200
this one.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:16,850
So let me just comment this one out and when we get there, then we'll adjust it.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,460
So we have our method stub and I'm just going to copy so I can move quickly with prepping this method

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:25,970
stub.

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,780
Right.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,500
And this one will be update hotel.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,380
No, in terms of the detail that will be used for hotel.

28
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,380
Well, firstly, we need the parameter for the ID.

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,830
You know, there are two schools of thought or maybe three schools of thought on this matter.

30
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,820
Let's say two school of thought.

31
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:56,060
Number one is that I need to have the ID in the euro, just like we had with the get right.

32
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,750
So I need to need you to pass and ID with the euro.

33
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,900
But then one school of thought would say that the DTL also needs to have the ID.

34
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:11,000
So that means the client needs to pass in the idea with the euro and depositing the body of data to

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,870
be updated.

36
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:19,010
Now that is one potential validation point where you would check if the idea that wasn't in your matches,

37
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:25,880
the ID sent over in the payload or the to and if there's a mismatch, then you return maybe.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,790
But request.

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,440
All right.

40
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,470
So that is one method of doing it.

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,140
And I'm just talking you through it before I actually do it.

42
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:39,450
The other one would be that the DTA doesn't need to have the ID because the it is going to be in the

43
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:39,950
euro.

44
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:46,460
So I expect you to pass over the euro with the idea of the record you wish to update, and then you

45
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,820
just pass me the updated information and I apply it accordingly.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,510
Now, that is also an acceptable train of thought.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,330
They're both acceptable once again, context rules.

48
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,930
So some people feel more comfortable with the doublecheck having to ID the euro and the body and then

49
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,280
you check and then if they don't match, then you reject that.

50
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,070
And some people don't mind having it one place and just going along with the operation.

51
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,620
So we're going to take the approach where we have it one place and not in the deal.

52
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,220
Now, because of that, I could use that creates a lot of detail.

53
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:31,550
But then to me, that would kind of violate the single responsibility rule that I've been kind of promoting.

54
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:37,820
Because when you say create a hotel deal, it doesn't anybody reading the code that this is for creation,

55
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,030
why is it in the update now you have two options.

56
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,390
Again, you could either rename this to maybe something like absurd, where this detail serves the purpose

57
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:51,620
of creating and updating or inserting and updating.

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,510
Hence the portmanteau.

59
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,030
Absurd, right.

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,320
But then once again, still single responsibility depends on how strict do want to be.

61
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:08,450
You could also realize that you might have varying fields in the two details because what you would

62
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:13,280
accept for creation, you might not expose all of that for potential update.

63
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,710
So you want to consider all those things.

64
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,940
So what I would do is actually create a second detail.

65
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,540
So I created another one, I call it, of the total detail.

66
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,460
In this context, everything that is here for the creation is fair game for update.

67
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:31,480
All right.

68
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:36,140
So I'm not going to go ahead and create another one at all.

69
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,990
I did was just inherit.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,340
So I'm just doing this because of the single responsibility concept that I have in mind.

71
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:47,780
I also want to make sure that when you see updated to detail, you know what it's for.

72
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,860
However, otherwise, what you probably want to do is just be more particular with the fields that you

73
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,520
expose in detail.

74
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,930
And we've seen where that can help with some control already.

75
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:04,580
So I'm just going to go ahead with that level of inheritance once again.

76
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,510
That's up to you.

77
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,040
We just want to write clean code and make sure it's readable at the end of the day.

78
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,360
Right.

79
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:18,260
So I'm taking the idea in the parameter and then I'm taking the fields for the update in the body of

80
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,100
the request.

81
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,950
So I'm going to start off with my validation.

82
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:33,560
Check someone to see if not model state dot is valid, if it is not valid or if the idea value sent

83
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,010
over is less than one, because I mean, it should be at least one right.

84
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,700
To be zero or negative.

85
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:49,070
So in either situation, I just want to log and return, but request that something is wrong with your

86
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,760
attempt.

87
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,270
Right.

88
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,220
And then we can move on to our try and catch.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:03,170
And then we know that for the cat section, we're going to be logging the error as well as.

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,600
Turning the status, five hundred, right, so let us see what we're going to try.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,630
No, in order to try, I need the original record that needs to be updated.

92
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:25,040
So what I have to do is actually see VAR Hotel is equal to a weight unit of work, not hotels that get

93
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:33,350
me the report cards put in my filter where the idea is equivalent to the idea coming in through the

94
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,170
parameter.

95
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,480
All right.

96
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:44,230
Then I can do another check, I can see if a hotel is equivalent to no.

97
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,730
So I could have done a search, maybe they passed into the ID 10.

98
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:52,640
I would left six hotels and a pass in 10 with something to update.

99
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,130
I'm going to try and find it, but I need to make sure that I actually found it right.

100
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,540
So then I would probably it's a bad request.

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:13,320
So let's say I do the same thing here, but in the buttocks section, I'm going to see submitted data

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,480
is invalid.

103
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,440
All right.

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,700
So there's no modesty there.

105
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,100
It's just a matter of those the record with that idea exists or not.

106
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,420
And you could actually even just extend the unit of work to do the exists.

107
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,910
But what I'm doing is just getting it one time.

108
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,360
If it if it's not, then we end it.

109
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:37,890
However, if it is not null, then we can go ahead and try to do our bit.

110
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,890
Now, a quick way to kind of equate the two would be to use the mopper.

111
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,160
Dot map.

112
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:55,650
And then I can see at this point what is the source, so the source series hotel and then I'm going

113
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,040
to see I want it to be no, I'm sorry.

114
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,970
The source would be the detail.

115
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,930
My apologies.

116
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:08,010
So hotel detail is the new source because hotel detail has the latest information.

117
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,440
And then I'm going to say hotel to the right.

118
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,020
So if we look at this mumper overload, it takes two things the source and the destination.

119
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,310
And then what it's going to do is just map what's in the source to the existing destination.

120
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,380
So effectively, we just said whatever is in this, put it in that if there are two things that are

121
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,090
not equal, then please update this one with the feeds coming from the detail.

122
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:36,480
Right.

123
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:45,060
And then we can all see unit of where the problem is that we did not do any tracking.

124
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,690
So if we were doing tracking, we could have just said save.

125
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:56,640
But we are not trucking stuff to c update and then pass in hotel.

126
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,380
Right.

127
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,760
And then we.

128
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,070
You know, it's all work.

129
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,900
So this one extra line of code, not too bad.

130
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:14,190
So the thing is that I remember I was explaining that with the update method, what we did was to see

131
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,160
please pay attention to whatever entities here.

132
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,070
I touch it and change it state to modify it.

133
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:21,530
So know that it's modified.

134
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,430
So when we save, it will be kind of in the register to be saved or updated.

135
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:26,660
Right.

136
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:35,910
If we had not or if we had made the tracting optional, then we wouldn't have had to take that extra

137
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,070
step of seeing updates.

138
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,470
We could have just done the change and see of the because trucking is actually by default.

139
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,490
So I'm just explaining that a little bit to because I didn't mention it.

140
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:53,600
So let us after we save, we can return the content.

141
00:09:54,510 --> 00:10:02,100
So no content seems like a bad reply, but it's really a tool for which is anything in the 200 range

142
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,490
is good.

143
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:02,860
Right.

144
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,820
So that's a good because I don't have anything to tell you.

145
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,650
Like, OK, you sent an update.

146
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,600
OK, there is nothing more to do.

147
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,120
You're good to go.

148
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:11,530
Right.

149
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,210
So that's what the content is really for.

150
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:21,270
So coming back to the one that we commented, it's not just status two or four.

151
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:30,370
So let us test that, so just to bring attention to what Strugar is doing, you'll see that each type

152
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,080
is nice, the color coded.

153
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:38,260
So if the word wasn't enough, then you see the color code put is nicely stated there.

154
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,020
And there's already teal with the feels and it's expecting an ID value in the parameters.

155
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,330
All right.

156
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:51,130
So let's use Postnet and I'm going to go right back to the last hotel that we created.

157
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,660
So this was our successful post attempt and we got it back.

158
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,610
So the ID value is six.

159
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:06,700
So I'm going to say put is my verb and I'm passing in six, says the ID value, and then I'm going to

160
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,410
put a comma.

161
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,510
This was misspelled.

162
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,370
It's a tiny, tiny change here.

163
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:12,640
But let's us see.

164
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,790
The comma underrating isn't really five, but it's four point eight for MoonPies Jamaica Grand Resort

165
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:21,480
and of the countries, Jamaica.

166
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,420
So let's leave that.

167
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,130
So let's go ahead and send and see what happens.

168
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,370
All right.

169
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:35,320
Method not slow and oh, I think I know why we didn't put on the parameter alone here on the put.

170
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,650
So the same way that we have this on the HTP get out to specify on the put that it should take that

171
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:42,370
parameter.

172
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,950
So apologies.

173
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,170
Let's just add that and let's try this again.

174
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,420
So buckin Posman.

175
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,610
I think I should get the for one this time.

176
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:51,940
All right.

177
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,650
That's better.

178
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:59,410
So the four or five I'm not allowed means that either you have something wrong with the request or your

179
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,560
endpoint needs to be fixed to match.

180
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,850
Holder should look.

181
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,980
So just know that's what we ran into.

182
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:10,910
We had the request properly, but then the endpoint was lacking.

183
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,290
All right.

184
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:17,200
So it's good to see these little things along the way so that when they happen, you can take control

185
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,010
of the situation.

186
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:25,360
So what we need to do is get a token and I believe I still have my user request over here.

187
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,010
So it's really cool with Bowsman.

188
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,860
You can always go back and get previous requests.

189
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:39,790
So let me just grab my token, come back over here, add it to the authorization header and then try

190
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,630
this again.

191
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,550
And it's hitting my and since our break point there.

192
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,270
All right.

193
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,590
So let's continue.

194
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,770
And there it is, tool for no content.

195
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,430
So it has successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content with no content.

196
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,630
But once again, a tool for it is a good return type.

197
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,340
So let us know.

198
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,750
Go over to our previous get and see what happens.

199
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,490
And I have a token.

200
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:16,120
So let me just go ahead and put this token here and do the get and then we will see.

201
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:16,590
All right.

202
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,990
There's our Cummo and there is a rating change to four point eight.

203
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,050
So as far as are concerned, the put works.

204
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,180
No, just building on what the put does and doesn't do.

205
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,940
You see, if you miss of something, let's see.

206
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,960
You have some features that are not required.

207
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:35,860
All right.

208
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,700
Right.

209
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,230
No, it's hard to test, but I'm going to go ahead and modify this detail.

210
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,640
So let me go over to create D2 and I'm going to see that the address field is not required.

211
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,050
All right.

212
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,640
I want to restart.

213
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,810
So why this restart?

214
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,700
Let me just explain what we're about to do.

215
00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:00,010
The put is always going to replace the data.

216
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,470
The only thing it doesn't replace is the idea pretty much.

217
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,800
Right.

218
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:09,880
So any time you're going to do a put, you have to be mindful that whatever data is there, it is going

219
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,320
to use it to replace.

220
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,830
If I don't provide an address, let's address all of this.

221
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,510
It's no longer required.

222
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,660
I don't provide an address.

223
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,470
What I'm doing the put.

224
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,730
I'm doing the update.

225
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,580
Right.

226
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,980
Same hotel and I'm doing the update and I send.

227
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,290
All right, so I'm getting a tool for no content, but look at what happens to my data.

228
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,560
So notice we had an address volume.

229
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,490
No.

230
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,180
Address is no.

231
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,880
So you have to be careful whenever you're using these kinds of updates or at least to put because it's

232
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,090
always going to replace it with the data that it got.

233
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:58,820
So it is on you to make sure that your validations represent the data quality that you really want from

234
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,920
your client application, whether you are building the client or it's a third party who is building

235
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,460
the client.

236
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:12,650
The app is yours and you have to set that standard because it not being required load and all of it

237
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:19,100
to be there know once again that could be good or bad based on your situation, but that is how the

238
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,260
pot will work.

239
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:28,760
So I'm going to encourage you right now to pause, replicate the put endpoint for the country's controller.

240
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,760
And then we're going to look at something else as it relates to the port and how we can enter a bit

241
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,630
more data than where I am right now.

242
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,140
All right.

243
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,380
So we're back.

244
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:45,320
And I hope you paused and attempted it yourself, but I already did the update country, and I'll just

245
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,430
walk you through it quickly.

246
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,540
There's nothing here that's out of the ordinary compared to the hotels.

247
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,370
Everything is fairly standard.

248
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:56,120
You have to create contra detail, which I did.

249
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,890
There we go.

250
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,730
It's a good thing I'm doing this review.

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,360
All right.

252
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,130
So it did contribute to contribute to and everything else just looks the same way.

253
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,110
No.

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:13,220
One thing that I want to point out with the update contra detail is that I have included this property,

255
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:16,100
which is a list of hotels.

256
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:16,940
All right.

257
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:24,700
So, yes, arguably I could put it here and then remove it from this one and then let the country need

258
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:30,220
to inherit from the update contra details since it does all of these on the list.

259
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,060
So this would get everything.

260
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,350
Yes, you could do that.

261
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:39,380
But then this is just driving home my point that you really want to kind of keep your details as unique

262
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,900
as possible, because then, you know, you may have shared feels sure, but then you may have unique

263
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,380
files also along the way.

264
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:58,190
Know, the relevance of this list of hotels is that I can actually use my port to update a company and

265
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:04,860
also insert new hotels are related hotels because remember that hotels.

266
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:11,930
This means that one country has a list of hotels or one country as many hotels, which is why we can

267
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:13,940
reference them by list here.

268
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,050
All right.

269
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,720
So let's explore what that would look like.

270
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:26,330
So if I go over to my swagga documentation and then look at the potential pillared you see here where

271
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:36,020
they're showing me that I can put in the name, the short name and then an array of hotels, and then

272
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,790
I can put in details for the hotel.

273
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,540
And of course, the hotel has potential details for the country.

274
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:47,360
And then this is what they really meant when they said it could become sightly because it's just one

275
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,160
big thing after another, after another.

276
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:58,250
However, we're going to try this and we're going to insert a new hotel we're sorry, a new country

277
00:17:58,250 --> 00:17:59,690
with a new hotel.

278
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,440
So I'm going to just duplicate this port so I can certainly say duplicate tab since I already have it

279
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:06,890
there.

280
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,720
Before I do that, let me see all of the countries that I have.

281
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,330
So I don't really have any tests with country.

282
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,210
So let me get all my countries so I can see my options.

283
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:31,070
So I have Jamaica, Bahamas and Cayman Islands and see if we need to update Cayman Islands because of

284
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,270
Cayman Island.

285
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,420
It should be islands of cosmetics.

286
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,300
But let's just go ahead and update that.

287
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,940
So I'm going to take let me just get my bearings.

288
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,480
So I'm going to take the payload from the sample right.

289
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:57,500
From our Soga and then the country's.

290
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:09,850
Sorry, the countries I had that I want to update, I'm just trying to find where that was the countryside's

291
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:14,530
three, so the name will be Cayman Islands.

292
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:22,980
The come the end point would be country slash three.

293
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,390
All right, the short name still S.I.

294
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,780
So once again, you have to provide the value that you expect to have there afterwards.

295
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,170
All right.

296
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:42,350
And then I'm going to go inside of the hotel section, remove anything that I really don't want.

297
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:42,780
Right.

298
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,000
As a matter of fact, let me go back over to the detail.

299
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,680
I just noticed that I'm listing out hotel detail here.

300
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,260
So I did say we could consolidate.

301
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,940
But here's a good reason I'm not consolidating.

302
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,650
I said hotel detail, hotel detail then puts in the ID.

303
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:08,900
But if I'm doing an insert, I'm updating Cayman Islands while I want to insert a new hotel automatically,

304
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,280
which means I don't need the added value.

305
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,730
So this DTA is actually incorrect.

306
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:21,890
What I should have here is create a hotel DTL, which is a better representation of the data I wish

307
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:28,190
to collect and that would also get rid of the excess feels like the country and the extended list of

308
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:28,590
hotels.

309
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:30,150
So let's try that again.

310
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:30,940
All right.

311
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,980
So now when I look in Swiger and I look at the the schema, that looks much better.

312
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,620
So you see details are very important.

313
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,870
What do you require from your user?

314
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,370
Make sure you expose only that.

315
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,430
So I'm going to take this corrected payload, go back to Boston, and this will be far less confusing

316
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,790
for me.

317
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,090
Right.

318
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,680
So let's try this again.

319
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:59,180
This is going to be Cayman Islands with a capital I write.

320
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,190
The name is still S.I.

321
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,620
I have to provide that.

322
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,430
And then in the hotels section, I can actually list all the hotels or objects of hotels.

323
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,660
So this square market means area.

324
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:18,530
Then the current embrace encapsulates all the object properties and I can see come up and list so I

325
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,440
can through comma and continuing to put them in.

326
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:21,690
Right.

327
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:28,510
So here I'm going to put in the Ritz Carlton and its address is Grand Cayman.

328
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,940
It has everything on five and another one, the local hotel.

329
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,570
So these are actually hotels in Grand Cayman.

330
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,490
You can look them up if you want to verify that.

331
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,010
However, I'm not going to specify the countryside.

332
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,970
All right.

333
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:50,030
So I'm actually going to remove your ID, but then I do have it as required.

334
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,570
So I'm going to remove it in the payload.

335
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:59,120
And what I'll do is make the change in the code itself for the DTL.

336
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:06,710
Let's just go over there and make it not required, at least just for this experiment and let us try

337
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,940
that.

338
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:08,420
So change made.

339
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,980
We have the list of hotels.

340
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,030
They're not referencing any country at the moment.

341
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,250
However, they are underneath the country's payload.

342
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,780
We have the country ideastream.

343
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,800
So let us send.

344
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,140
And I'm getting a tool for no content, so let me go and check.

345
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,970
So let me get the list of hotels and see what came back.

346
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,840
All right, here we go.

347
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:44,310
So we have the local hotel coming back with an idea seven and the Ritz Carlton coming back with an idea

348
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,960
of eight, and both of them are part of country three or keep in mind.

349
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,140
So you see, that is how you can actually use the put.

350
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,300
So the put will see, does this thing exist?

351
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,210
If not, I will create it.

352
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,190
And the only way it knows it exists is if the ID value is provided.

353
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,650
So when there's no ID value is going to say, well, this doesn't have an I.D. so I will go ahead and

354
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,340
create it.

355
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,720
However, because of our constraints that we put on our end point, we are not allowing people to just

356
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:24,360
use the port to create because we do verify that ID value must be present or have, you know, a sensible

357
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,140
added value must be present before we move on.

358
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,330
So those are the constraints they can use to make sure that the port operates.

359
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,370
So you want it to.

360
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:38,040
However, its global operation is very versatile.
