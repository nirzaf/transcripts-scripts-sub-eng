Hey, guys, one quick addendum to what was done in the previous activity, setting up the registration

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:08,060
endpoints and everything, it worked.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:14,840
However, when I checked the data, I realized that my user did not have a password, and that's because

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,360
I did not put this part on.

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,390
So if you look at the create user function.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,530
It has to overtones, one where it just creates the user and another one where it asks you for the user

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,110
and the password to go with them.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:35,930
So I'm not entirely sure why they feel the need to me to because for me, a user has to have a password.

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,360
But I guess for different situations, they may need to store something on the other.

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,680
So user karma and then from the user need to go to the password so that we can ensure that when the

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,160
user manager creates that user, that password is also going to get touched and stored on their record.
