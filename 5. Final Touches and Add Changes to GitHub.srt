00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,630
All right, guys, so we're back in our project and our task today is simple, we're just sworn to take

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,950
in all our changes.

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,930
So anything with our Atik would have been modified along the way once again and anything with a green

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,190
plus sign was added.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,150
So we can just go ahead and go to get changes.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,830
And I'm just going to refresh what I don't need to refresh here all my changes listed.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,140
So I'm going to put in my message.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,600
And my message is just letting everybody know that I did the country and the hotel get my thoughts.

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,450
Also fix the units of work by short for dependency injection reference, because remember, we made

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,340
that modification in the start so I can go ahead and commit and sync.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,830
And once that is done, we're ready to move on to our next module.
