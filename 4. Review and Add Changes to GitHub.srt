00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,770
Our guys, so we're once again at another milestone, what we're going to do is check in over changes.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:16,160
So we added all the missing endpoints for the post, the puts and the delete requests for both hotels

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,090
and countries.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,780
And the concepts that you've learned along the way can be applied as well as many times as you need

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,220
them to, as many endpoints as you need to facilitate.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,040
You can apply them also.

7
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,860
So we just go ahead and go to get changes at our message.

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,090
And then what I'm going to do is just commit all and sync.

9
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,430
And once that is completed, then you can stick around for the next adventure.
