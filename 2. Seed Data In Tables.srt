00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,740
Hey, guys, welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,460
So in this lesson, we're going to be going through a process called seating.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,050
So seating is where we provide some initial data to the database.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,650
And what we're actually going to do is just hardcoded some records that when we perform a migration

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,830
afterwards, the migration will have instructions to create these records of the database with these

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,600
records, and it won't necessarily rely on user input.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:33,510
So at least that will provide a nice basis for our testing when we start developing the API endpoints.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:42,750
So what we want to do is go to our database context and where we're going to override a protected method

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,480
that is really inside of the DB context.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:54,480
So protected override void on model creating and we are passing in the parameter model builder and I'm

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,650
just calling it builder.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:05,520
And then what we'll see is something like a builder dot entity and then I have to specify which entity

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,090
I'm dealing with.

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,470
So we have control of hotel countries have to exist for hotels to exist.

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,120
And that's really because of how we define our records, right?

16
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,230
We said country and hotel as a foreign key, so we have to have the country before we can put in that

17
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:25,850
foreign key.

18
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,240
So would just say entity country that has data.

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,050
Oh, I'm sorry.

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,340
I'm missing a record period there.

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:37,760
Right.

22
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,060
So into the country.

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,360
And then open and close race has data data so open and close race.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,050
And then inside of this, we're going to define some countries so we can define as many because it takes

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:04,400
an artist or has data really takes an array of type country so we can define a few records here.

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,440
So I'm just going to define three.

27
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,740
All right.

28
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,710
So new country record with ID equals one.

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,420
And once again, we are putting in the data, so we have to manually provide all of these values.

30
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,390
And this is the first country that I'm putting.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,220
And the short name is Jim.

32
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:37,200
All right, and I'm just going to copy this and paste it cannot reduce the typing, so this would be

33
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,150
too and this would be three.

34
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,060
And the next one, let's see, Bahamas.

35
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:57,160
And the short name for Bahama, if I'm not mistaken, is the S and then the next one would be Cayman

36
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,740
Islands.

37
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,850
So I'm just choosing some destination, some popular tourist destinations where you'd probably want

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,830
to know what hotels are there.

39
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,160
Right.

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,150
So the short name for Cayman Islands would be.

41
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:17,570
All right, if I'm not all that accurate, then later on we can to it.

42
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,690
But for now, once again, these are example records, right?

43
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,430
So I did that for country.

44
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:28,810
I would just repeat that feat for the hotels.

45
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,130
Right.

46
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,920
So I'm just I just copied and pasted most of the code.

47
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:41,560
I noticed that at the hotel it is going to change the expected parameters to type hotel or whether it's

48
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,070
seeing objects because it's not getting hotels here.

49
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,740
So that's fine.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,170
We'll just resort to hotel.

51
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,900
All right, I mean, what else did we have for the hotel address?

52
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,170
So let me get this.

53
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,830
So this is Sondos Resort and Spa, so I'm actually familiar with some of them.

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,870
Address.

55
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,430
Let's just keep it short and see the grill.

56
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:18,520
We already know the country, the country is Jamaica, so your idea would be one, right?

57
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:27,170
And then the rating is the last I heard it was, I'm going to say four point five.

58
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:33,320
But I know it's a five star kind of resort, so I'm just going to copy these details down.

59
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,160
All right, so we have a hotel for Jamaica.

60
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:49,660
I mean, just put a hotel per country just to make sure that we're spread right across and I'm just

61
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,960
going to make up something for Sunday for Bahamas.

62
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,980
So Bahamas, let's see.

63
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,940
They have grand.

64
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:09,260
Grand Paladium, so I know for sure Grand Paladium is a hotel in Jamaica, but for example sake we're

65
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,470
putting it there or puts it at their own place.

66
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:12,960
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,160
So this would be contrary to let's just do that.

68
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,590
And that's a four star.

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:28,890
Once again, this is not factual, we're just making up data, right, so far, cavemen, they have

70
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,960
comfort seats.

71
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,280
And dress that, said George.

72
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:45,480
On the contrary, these three, four cavemen and they're eating is four point three.

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,110
All right.

74
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,950
So that's also feeding some data into the database so this can get a bit crowded.

75
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,030
You could just collapse it like that so it doesn't take up too much space.

76
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:05,010
Or what I tend to do also is actually move it to underneath the DB definitions so that when I come to

77
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,280
make modifications to the device, it's always just stack them on top.

78
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,840
I don't have to scroll all the way past that.

79
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,940
There are ways to extract this and put them in other files and call the configurations also.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,650
But then this is just a quick, quick, quick, quickly to see the data into the database.

81
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,540
So now that we have defined a few test records, the next thing that we want to do is add on migration.

82
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,500
So I'm going to add migration.

83
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:44,910
And this one, we're going to call the seeding data or so notice that each time the migration I try

84
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:51,260
to be descriptive enough with the name such that you can tell, oh, that's what happened at that point.

85
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,760
So it's almost like source control for the data.

86
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,080
Right.

87
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:01,770
And if you look at this, this migration file, you'll actually see here where it is insert data into

88
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,520
this table.

89
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,870
And these are the columns and those are the data volumes.

90
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,330
Right.

91
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,740
So it will go ahead and do all of that, right?

92
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,180
I don't know.

93
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,510
I turned my four point three to four point two, nine, nine and eight.

94
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,930
Not sure why, but that's just how it is going to reformat it so that they can do the insertions.

95
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:32,250
So the next thing that we want to do is update their database so that it can effectively carry out the

96
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,850
commands in the migration.

97
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,110
So it did see it done.

98
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,920
What I want to do is go back to my object explorer and then I'm going to right.

99
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,310
Click and view data on the country's table.

100
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,470
And there we go.

101
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,910
We have data in our database.

102
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:55,590
So we have successfully created our three countries and we can look at the matching.

103
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,630
Hotels.

104
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:06,630
All right, so that is how you can put initial data into your dominant core applications using entity,

105
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,360
framework core and the DB context.
