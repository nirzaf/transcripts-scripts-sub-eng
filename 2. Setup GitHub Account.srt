Hey, guys, in this video will be creating or GitHub Balcones, and this is a really simplistic getup,

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,060
makes it very easy for us to sign up.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,210
You just need to go to get tubed up.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:21,840
Come, that's g i t to B dot seal and get tubed up and you will land on this bridge from here.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
If you already have an account then you can sign in and you can pretty much stop watching the video

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,730
here.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,450
If you don't however, then the Senate form is right here.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,230
You can do a little reading just to get an appreciation of what GitHub is for.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,280
And it's all about they do have pricing, so they do offer enterprise plans and education plans and

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,930
different plans for different situations.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:50,010
But for the solar developer or for very small teams, that may not be enterprise level, then they do

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,410
give you a lot for free.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,120
So to sign up, you need only put in a user name and an email address and a password.

14
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,400
And once you have provided all those things and provided that your user name is unique and of course,

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,010
then you sign up for GitHub and you should be in.

16
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,970
So I already have an account, so I'm really just going to sign in.

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,700
You saw my brothers are going crazy trying to provide information, so I'm just going to sign in with

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,260
my existing account.

19
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,690
So that's my what?

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,560
You can use your username or email address to sign in and the password.

21
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,900
And here I am.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,040
This is my landing page.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,640
So they actually give you like a sense of community.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,590
It's almost like a Facebook for developers.

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,710
To some extent you can follow people and once they're following people, you see their activities on

26
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,590
the landing page, you can jump to your repository.

27
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,090
So obviously, if you're new to GitHub, then you wouldn't have anything listed to the site here.

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,940
But I'm not new, so I've been quite busy putting content on GitHub.

29
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,410
Almost any little pet project.

30
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,280
That's a start.

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,280
I have a GitHub repository, actually.

32
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,060
I need to go through and clean this up.

33
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:07,320
And also I've had students add me to their reports in the past so that we could collaborate.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,090
Maybe they were having a problem and I could just verify their code through the repository.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,160
All of those things are, you know, possible through this very powerful tool.

36
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,860
But once you have created your account and you're signed in and, well, you obviously wouldn't see

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,110
what I'm seeing once again, but then that would complete the sign of active.
