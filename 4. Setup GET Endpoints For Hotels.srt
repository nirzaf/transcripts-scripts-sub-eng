1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,990
All right, guys, so I'm issuing a challenge to you, I want you to pause the video.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,430
Yes, it just started, but go ahead and pause it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,200
And I want you to go ahead and create a controller for the hotels you can call a total controller and

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:19,730
the functionality that we have just gone through with our country controller.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,720
I want you to replicate it in the context of the hotels.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,400
So I already have it here.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,620
But I want you to pause.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,030
We're going to go through it together.

9
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:34,550
But I want you to pause activity to yourself and then we compare notes.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,370
All right, so I'm back and I'm saying I'm back because I'm assuming that you pause the video, I know

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,130
you're resuming.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,640
I know we can go through it together.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,960
So here we have the hotel controller and I went through the same steps there.

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,920
I clicked, controllers clicked, add data controller, a blank API controller called the total controller.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,480
I went ahead and injected basically the same services that were in the control controller and initialize

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,190
them in the constructor.

17
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,500
Know everything pretty much is identical.

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,660
The only things that really changed were my variable names, because obviously I'm not going to call

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,270
this one countries if we're getting hotel.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:25,680
So get hotels instead of get countries, get hotels instead of get hotels and similarily, you'd want

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,610
to get to a hotel by IBE.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:35,520
Another thing that I would want to point out would be the mapping where mapping to hotel detail.

23
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,470
And the final thing would be that I've kind of added more attributes.

24
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,400
So as you see the attributes kind of Eden, it indicates that at least swagga and I mean, it does dictate

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,530
the behavior, but sluggard does depend on it's also to know how to formulate that documentation.

26
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,230
So right here, I'm letting her know that this method produces 200.

27
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:08,820
It also produces five hundred, because if you recall, when we looked at Strugar and a return to five

28
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,080
hundred, you would have seen some things being undocumented underneath that 500 error.

29
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,730
And so we want to just make sure that Swiger contextually tells as much information to the developer

30
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,760
as possible at any given time.

31
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,480
So that I bring up swagga.

32
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,130
You're going to see the segregation country different from hotel.

33
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,130
All right.

34
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,430
I hope you're seeing this.

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:40,230
And if we look at hotel or any one of these that the attributes was both attributes were added to,

36
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,830
you could see that the five hundred wasn't there initially to see the two.

37
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,420
No, 500 wasn't there initially.

38
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,450
All right.

39
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,760
So that does work out for someone to use postmen to do some testing.

40
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,520
So I still have my test from the time.

41
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,950
And the thing is, with Postman, you can always just start a new type, right?

42
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:10,590
So instead of using one tub to continuously be changing, I went to have one for the get to know parameter

43
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,230
street over here.

44
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,070
So this is no parameter.

45
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,660
Let's see if that works.

46
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,560
All right, so I really didn't test Michael before.

47
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,540
No, I wrote it and I didn't test it, and I'm happy to see that it's working.

48
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,530
All right.

49
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,070
And then the one with the parameter.

50
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:38,550
That also works, and for now, that's all there is to setting up our controllers.

51
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,100
All right.

52
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:44,660
So as many controllers as you might have, of course, variations and based on context, certain things

53
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,350
may differ.

54
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:53,550
But we have a good template upon which we can build our get operations.

55
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:53,960
All right.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,440
So you can go ahead and just start this off.

57
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,140
And then when we come back, we'll be pushing our changes to our repositories.
